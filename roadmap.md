# Stuff To Do

- [x] Cursor Domain Axis label
- [ ] Axis label overflow (when too many)
- [ ] Axis label rotation
- [ ] Axis label trimming
- [ ] Dark theme doesn't seem to be working
- [ ] Error handling to know what blew up
- [x] Horizontal charts don't work
- [ ] Zoom / Pan Behaviour also injected from config
- [ ] Refactor spaghetti (series/axes js files getting fucking wild)
- [ ] Inheritance model for config, only have to set config for whatever needs to be over-written
  - [ ] Create a base config, project-specific-overwrites too

# Bigger Picture Stuff

- [ ] Builder pattern for config building
- [ ] Bunch of date parsing stuff
- [ ] Auto chart picker based on data
- [ ] Auto set colors based on project maps (soccer:red|HIIT:blue)
- [ ] Nicer color palletes in general
